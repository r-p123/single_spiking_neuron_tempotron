# Tempotron Model with random input sequence

Gütig, R., Sompolinsky, H. The tempotron: a neuron that learns spike timing–based decisions. Nat Neurosci 9, 420–428 (2006). https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1643

Model classifies between two random sequences. One is labelled as "positive" and one is "negative." The cell should fire for the positive sequence and not fire for the negative sequence as shown below. This can be extended to a set of positive sequences and negative sequences.
